How to Think When Deriving DP Formulas
Here’s a mental checklist:

Define subproblems clearly
➤ “What’s the best result we can get if the subarray ends at index i?”

Identify choices at each step
➤ Can we continue or must we restart?

Decide based on optimal substructure
➤ What’s the best result if I choose one vs. the other?

Build recurrence using “max”, “min”, or “sum”
➤ Depends on whether you're maximizing, minimizing, or counting

Always start with a base case
➤ Typically index 0 or empty case
